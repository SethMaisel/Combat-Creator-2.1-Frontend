Welcome to the "Combat Creator" app!
Deployment coming soon!

This app is designed to make fight choreography easier by allowing choreographers, directors, and actors to design and read the choreographed sequences in a clear and readable manner.

Once a user is created, the user can create individual fights and name them whatever they want.  I suggest going by play, act, and scene or page number.

Inside a created fight, create a character.  That character should be the one performing the individual sequence (the attack or defense).

Once the character is created, the user will be presented with drop-down menus to select weapon (what the character is attacking or defending with), action (advance, retreat, etc), technique (cut, punch, parry, etc.) and line (high outside, head, upstage, etc).

Select each portion of the sequence and create.  This sequence will display as the first exchange of the fight.  
Continue the process with each character, attack, and defense.  

Your fight will be shown in an easy-to-follow display that can be shared with actors and directors.

Fights and sequences can be deleted at any time.

Future functionality:

Update individual sequences so that deletion isn't necessary to change the fight.
More action, technique, and line options.
Create your own weapons, actions, techniques, and lines (I can't think of everything the playwrights create!).
Animate your fight sequences and see your combat play out!
